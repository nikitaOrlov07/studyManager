# üìö Multi-Service Application

**A powerful, feature-rich multi-service application** designed to handle various user and course-related operations. It consists of **7 microservices** working seamlessly together to deliver robust functionality, including real-time chat, authentication, and course management.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Microservice Architecture

### 1. **Main Service (View Service)**
   - **Role**: Central hub for gathering and displaying information to clients.
   - **Features**:
     - Stores **JWT tokens**, along with user device and IP information.
     - Implements real-time **WebSocket-based chat** for user interaction.
     - **Database**: Stores JWT tokens and user details.

### 2. **Authentication Service**
   - **Role**: User authentication and JWT generation.
   - **Features**:
     - Authenticates users via **HTTP requests** to the User Service.
     - Generates **JWT tokens** and forwards them to Main Service for storage.
     - Removes tokens from the database when users log out.

### 3. **Chat Service**
   - **Role**: Manage chats for users and courses.
   - **Features**:
     - Search, create, and delete user chats.
     - Manage **course-based chats** and store/delete messages.
     - Secured by JWT tokens passed from the Main Service.

### 4. **Course Service**
   - **Role**: Manage course information and assignments.
   - **Features**:
     - Stores and retrieves data related to courses and homework assignments.

### 5. **User Service**
   - **Role**: Manage user data.
   - **Features**:
     - Handles user registration, updates, and profile management.

### 6. **Notification Service**
   - **Role**: Send notifications related to user activity.
   - **Features**:
     - **Asynchronous communication** with User Service using **Apache Kafka**.
     - Sends notifications when users register or login into  their profiles.

### 7. **Discovery Service**
   - **Role**: Dynamic discovery and interaction between microservices.
   - **Features**:
     - Enables easy scaling and registration of new services without manual configuration.
